# Summary
[summary]: #summary

Support defining single inheritance relationships in `wasm-bindgen`'s imported
types. Specifically, we define static upcasts from a derived type to one of its
base types, checked dynamic casts from a type to any other type using
JavaScript's `instanceof` operator, and finally unchecked casts between any
JavaScript types as an escape hatch for developers. For the proc-macro frontend,
this is done by adding the `#[wasm_bindgen(extends = Base)]` attribute to the
derived type. For the WebIDL frontend, WebIDL's existing interface inheritance
syntax is used.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

Prototype chains and ECMAScript classes allow JavaScript developers to define
single inheritance relationships between types. [WebIDL interfaces can inherit
from one another,][webidl-inheritance] and Web APIs make widespread use of this
feature. We want to support calling base methods on an imported derived type and
passing an imported derived type to imported functions that expect a base type
in `wasm-bindgen`. We want to support dynamically checking whether some JS value
is an instance of a JS class, and dynamically-checked casts. Finally, the same
way that `unsafe` provides an encapsulatable escape hatch for Rust's ownership
and borrowing, we want to provide unchecked (but safe!) conversions between JS
classes and values.

# Stakeholders
[stakeholders]: #stakeholders

Anyone who is using `wasm-bindgen` directly or transitively through the
`web-sys` crate is affected. This does *not* affect the larger wasm ecosystem
outside of Rust (eg Webpack). Therefore, the usual advertisement of this RFC on
*This Week in Rust and WebAssembly* and at our working group meetings should
suffice in soliciting feedback.

# Detailed Explanation
[detailed-explanation]: #detailed-explanation

## Example Usage

Consider the following JavaScript class definitions:

```js
class MyBase { }
class MyDerived extends MyBase { }
```

We translate this into `wasm-bindgen` proc-macro imports like this:

```rust
#[wasm_bindgen]
extern {
    pub extern type MyBase;

    #[wasm_bindgen(extends = MyBase)]
    pub extern type MyDerived;
}
```

Note the `#[wasm_bindgen(extends = MyBase)]` annotation on `extern type
MyDerived`. This tells `wasm-bindgen` that `MyDerived` inherits from `MyBase`.

Alternatively, we could describe these same classes as WebIDL interfaces:

```webidl
interface MyBase {}
interface MyDerived : MyBase {}
```

### Example Upcasting

We can upcast into a `MyBase` from a `MyDerived` type using the normal `From`,
`AsRef`, `AsMut`, and `Into` conversions:

```rust
let derived: MyDerived = get_derived_from_somewhere();
let base: MyBase = derived.into();
```

### Example Dynamically-Checked Casting

We can do dynamically-checked (checked with JavaScript's `instanceof` operator)
downcasts from a `MyBase` into a `MyDerived` using the `dyn_{into,ref,mut}`
methods:

```
let base: MyBase = get_base_from_somewhere();
match base.dyn_into::<MyDerived>() {
    Ok(derived) => {
        // It was an instance of `MyDerived`!
    }
    Err(base) => {
        // It was some other kind of instance of `MyBase`.
    }
}
```

### Example Unchecked Casting

If we really know that a `MyBase` is an instance of `MyDerived` and we don't
want to pay the cost of a dynamic check, we can also use unchecked conversions:

```rust
let derived: MyDerived = get_derived_from_somewhere();
let base: MyBase = derived.into();

// We know that this is a `MyDerived` since we *just* converted it into `MyBase`
// from `MyDerived` above.
let derived: MyDerived = base.unchecked_into();
```

Unchecked casting serves as an escape hatch for developers, and while it can
lead to JavaScript exceptions, it cannot create memory unsafety.

## The `JsCast` Trait

For dynamically-checked and unchecked casting between arbitrary JavaScript
types, we introduce the `JsCast` trait. It requires implementations provide a
boolean predicate that consults JavaScript's `instanceof` operator, as well as
unchecked conversions from JavaScript values:

```rust
pub trait JsCast {
    fn instanceof(val: &JsValue) -> bool;

    fn unchecked_from_js(val: JsValue) -> Self;
    fn unchecked_from_js_ref(val: &JsValue) -> &Self;
    fn unchecked_from_js_mut(val: &mut JsValue) -> &mut Self;

    // ... provided methods elided ...
}
```

`JsCast`'s required trait methods are not intended to be used to directly, but
instead are leveraged by its provided methods. Users of `wasm-bindgen` will be
able to ignore `JsCast`'s required trait methods for the most part, since the
implementations will be mechanically generated, and they will only be using the
required trait methods indirectly through the more ergonomic provided methods.

For every `extern { type Illmatic; }` imported with `wasm-bindgen`, we emit an
implementation of `JsCast` similar to this:

```rust
impl JsCast for Illmatic {
    fn instanceof(val: &JsValue) -> bool {
        #[cfg(all(target_arch = "wasm32", not(target_os = "emscripten")))]
        #[wasm_import_module = "__wbindgen_placeholder__"]
        extern {
            fn __wbindgen_instanceof_Illmatic(idx: u32) -> u32;
        }

        #[cfg(not(all(target_arch = "wasm32", not(target_os = "emscripten"))))]
        unsafe extern fn __wbindgen_instanceof_Illmatic(_: u32) -> u32 {
            panic!("function not implemented on non-wasm32 targets")
        }

        __wbindgen_instance_of_MyDerived(val.idx) == 1
    }

    fn unchecked_from_js(val: JsValue) -> Illmatic {
        Illmatic {
            obj: val,
        }
    }

    fn unchecked_from_js_ref(val: &JsValue) -> &Illmatic {
        unsafe {
            &*(val as *const JsValue as *const Illmatic)
        }
    }

    fn unchecked_from_js_mut(val: &mut JsValue) -> &mut Illmatic {
        unsafe {
            &mut *(val as *mut JsValue as *mut Illmatic)
        }
    }
}
```

Additionally, `wasm-bindgen` will emit this JavaScript definition of
`__wbindgen_instanceof_Illmatic` that simply wraps the JS `instanceof` operator:

```js
const __wbindgen_instanceof_Illmatic = function (idx) {
  return getObject(idx) instanceof Illmatic;
};
```

### `JsCast`'s Provided Trait Methods

The `JsCast` trait's provided methods wrap the unergonomic required static trait
methods and provide ergonomic, chainable versions that operate on `self` and
*another* `T: JsCast`. For example, the `JsCast::is_instance_of` method asks if
`&self` is an instance of some *other* `T` that also implements `JsCast`.

```rust
pub trait JsCast
where
    Self: AsRef<JsValue> + AsMut<JsValue> + Into<JsValue>,
{
    // ... required trait methods elided ...

    // Unchecked conversions from `Self` into some other `T: JsCast`.

    fn unchecked_into<T>(self) -> T
    where
        T: JsCast,
    {
        T::unchecked_from_js(self.into())
    }

    fn unchecked_ref<T>(&self) -> &T
    where
        T: JsCast,
    {
        T::unchecked_from_js_ref(self.as_ref())
    }

    fn unchecked_mut<T>(&mut self) -> &mut T
    where
        T: JsCast,
    {
        T::unchecked_from_js_mut(self.as_mut())
    }

    // Predicate method to check whether `self` is an instance of `T` or not.

    fn is_instance_of<T>(&self) -> bool
    where
        T: JsCast,
    {
        T::instanceof(self.as_ref())
    }

    // Dynamically-checked conversions from `Self` into some other `T: JsCast`.

    fn dyn_into<T>(self) -> Result<T, Self>
    where
        T: JsCast,
    {
        if self.is_instance_of::<T>() {
            Ok(self.unchecked_into())
        } else {
            Err(self)
        }
    }

    fn dyn_ref<T>(&self) -> Option<&T>
    where
        T: JsCast,
    {
        if self.is_instance_of::<T>() {
            Some(self.unchecked_ref())
        } else {
            None
        }
    }

    fn dyn_mut<T>(&mut self) -> Option<&mut T>
    where
        T: JsCast,
    {
        if self.is_instance_of::<T>() {
            Some(self.unchecked_mut())
        } else {
            None
        }
    }
}
```

Using these methods provides better turbo-fishing syntax than using `JsCast`'s
required trait methods directly.

```rust
fn get_it() -> JsValue { ... }

// Tired -_-
SomeJsThing::unchecked_from_js(get_it()).method();

// Wired ^_^
get_it()
    .unchecked_into::<SomeJsThing>()
    .method();
```

### `JsCast` Implementation for `JsValue`

We also trivially implement `JsCast` for `JsValue` with no-ops, and add
`AsRef<JsValue>` and `AsMut<JsValue>` implementations for `JsValue` itself, so
that the `JsCast` super trait bounds are satisfied:

```rust
impl AsRef<JsValue> for JsValue {
    fn as_ref(&self) -> &JsValue {
        self
    }
}

impl AsMut<JsValue> for JsValue {
    fn as_mut(&mut self) -> &mut JsValue {
        self
    }
}

impl JsCast for JsValue {
    fn instanceof(_: &JsValue) -> bool {
        true
    }

    fn unchecked_from_js(val: JsValue) -> Self {
        val
    }

    fn unchecked_from_js_ref(val: &JsValue) -> &Self {
        val
    }

    fn unchecked_from_js_mut(val: &mut JsValue) -> &mut Self {
        val
    }
}
```

## Upcasting Implementation

For every `extends = MyBase` on a type imported with `extern type MyDerived`,
and for every base and derived interface in a WebIDL interface inheritance
chain, `wasm-bindgen` will emit these trait implementations that wrap unchecked
conversions methods from `JsCast` that we know are valid due to the inheritance
relationship:

1. A `From` implementation for `self`-consuming conversions:

   ```rust
   impl From<MyDerived> for MyBase {
       fn from(my_derived: MyDerived) -> MyBase {
           let val: JsValue = my_derived.into();
           <MyDerived as JsCast>::unchecked_from_js(val)
       }
   }
   ```

2. An `AsRef` implementation for shared reference conversions:

   ```rust
   impl AsRef<MyBase> for MyDerived {
       fn as_ref(&self) -> &MyDerived {
           let val: &JsValue = self.as_ref();
           <MyDerived as JsCast>::uncheck_from_js_ref(val)
       }
   }
   ```

3. An `AsMut` implementation for exclusive reference conversions:

   ```rust
   impl AsMut<MyBase> for MyDerived {
       fn as_mut(&mut self) -> &mut MyDerived {
           let val: &mut JsValue = self.as_mut();
           <MyDerived as JsCast>::uncheck_from_js_mut(val)
       }
   }
   ```

## Deep Inheritance Chains Example

For deeper inheritance chain, like this example:

```js
class MyBase {}
class MyDerived extends MyBase {}
class MyDoubleDerived extends MyDerived {}
```

the proc-macro imports require an `extends` attribute for every transitive base:

```rust
#[wasm_bindgen]
extern {
    pub extern type MyBase;

    #[wasm_bindgen(extends = MyBase)]
    pub extern type MyDerived;

    #[wasm_bindgen(extends = MyBase, extends = MyDerived)]
    pub extern type MyDoubleDerived;
}
```

On the other hand, the WebIDL frontend can understand the full inheritance chain
and nothing more than the usual interface inheritance syntax is required:

```webidl
interface MyBase {}
interface MyDerived : MyBase {}
interface MyDoubleDerived : MyDerived {}
```

Given these definitions, we can upcast a `MyDoubleDerived` all the way to a
`MyBase`:

```rust
let dub_derived: MyDoubleDerived = get_it_from_somewhere();
let base: MyBase = dub_derived.into();
```

# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

* We might accidentally *encourage* using this inheritance instead of the more
  Rust-idiomatic usage of traits.

# Rationale and Alternatives
[alternatives]: #rationale-and-alternatives

* We could define an `Upcast` trait instead of using the standard `From` and
  `As{Ref,Mut}` traits. This would make it more clear that we are doing
  inheritance-related casts, but would also be a new trait that folks would have
  to understand vs pretty much every Rust programmer's familiarity with the
  `std` traits.

* Upcasting using the `From` and `As{Ref,Mut}` traits does not provide
  chainable, turbofishing methods on `self` that one could use when type
  inference needs a helping hand. Instead, one must create a local variable with
  an explicit type.

  ```rust
  // Can't do this with upcasting.
  get_some_js_type()
    .into::<AnotherJsType>()
    .method();

  // Have to do this:
  let another: AnotherJsType = get_some_js_type().into();
  another.method();
  ```

  If we used a custom `Upcast` trait, we could provide turbofishable methods on
  `self`, at the cost of using non-standard traits.

* We could use `TryFrom` for dynamically-checked casts instead of
  `JsCast::dyn_into` et al. This would introduce a new nightly feature
  requirement when using `wasm-bindgen`. We leave the possibility open for when
  `TryFrom` is stabilized by not naming our dynamically-checked cast methods
  `JsCast::try_into` to be future compatible.

* Explicit upcasting still does not provide very good ergonomics. There are a
  couple things we could do here:

  * Use the `Deref` trait to hide upcasting. This is generally [considered an
    anti-pattern](https://github.com/rust-unofficial/patterns/blob/master/anti_patterns/deref.md).

  * Automatically create a `MyBaseMethods` trait for base types that contain all
    the base type's methods and implement that trait for `MyBase` and
    `MyDerived`? Also emit a `MyDerivedMethods` trait that requires `MyBase` as
    a super trait, representing the inheritance at the trait level? This is the
    Rust-y thing to do and allows us to write generic functions with trait
    bounds. This is what `stdweb` does with the `IHTMLElement` trait for
    `HTMLElement`'s methods.

    Whether we do this or not also happens to be orthogonal to casting between
    base and derived types. We leave exploring this design space to follow up
    RFCs, and hope to land just the casting in an incremental fashion.

* Traits sometimes get in the way of learning what one can do with a thing. They
  aren't as up-front in the generated documentation, and can lead people to
  thinking they *must* write code that is generic over a trait when it isn't
  necessary. There are two ways we could get rid of the `JsCast` trait:

  1. Only implement its methods on `JsValue` and require that conversions like
     `ImportedJsClassUno` -> `ImportedJsClassDos` go to `JsValue` in between:
     `ImportedJsClassUno` -> `JsValue` -> `ImpiortedJsClassDos`.

  2. We could redundantly implement all its methods on `JsValue` and imported JS
     classes directly.

* Unchecked casting could be marked `unsafe` to reflect that correctness relies
  on the programmer in these cases. However, misusing unchecked JS casts cannot
  introduce memory unsafety in the Rust sense, so this would be using `unsafe`
  as a general-purpose "you probably shouldn't use this" warning, which is not
  `unsafe`'s intended purpose.

* We could only implement unchecked casts for everything all the time. This
  would encourage a loose, shoot-from-the-hip programming style. We would prefer
  leveraging types when possible. We realize that escape hatches are still
  required at times, and we do provide arbitrary unchecked casts, but guide
  folks towards upcasting with `From`, `AsRef`, and `AsMut` and doing
  dynamically checks for other types of casts.

# Unresolved Questions
[unresolved]: #unresolved-questions

* Should the `JsCast` trait be re-exported in `wasm_bindgen::prelude`? We do not
  specify that it should be in this RFC, and we can initially ship without
  re-exporting it in prelude and see what it feels like. Based on experience, we
  may decide in the future to add it to the prelude.
