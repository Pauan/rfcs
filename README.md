# Rust and WebAssembly RFCs
[Rust RFCs]: #rust-rfcs

Many changes, including bug fixes and documentation improvements can be
implemented and reviewed via the normal GitHub pull request workflow.

Some changes though are "substantial", and we ask that these be put through a
bit of a design process and produce a consensus among the Rust and WebAssembly
community.

The "RFC" (request for comments) process is intended to provide a consistent and
controlled path for substantial changes and additions to enter the Rust and
WebAssembly ecosystem, so that all stakeholders can be confident about the
direction the ecosystem is evolving in.

## The RFC Process

When does a change require an RFC? How does an RFC get approved or rejected?
What is the RFC life cycle?

[These questions are answered in RFC 001][rfc-001].
